									<p >One of Ryon’s closest friends since middle school.  Chris and Ryon grew up across the street from each other and would often spend time getting beat in Goldeneye 007 by some of the neighborhood kids.

When time permits, Chris and Ryon like to reconnect over a drink and a sporting event, or even a lowkey Netflix night at the house.</p>

Now in college, Ryon couldn’t be prouder of Jonathan.  Ryon and Jonathan spend time catching up over dinner and discussing the latest episode of Dragon Ball Super.</p>
